| Key | Shape | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `schedule_iii` | object | The balance sheet as Schedule III prints it. A regrouping of what `CBLedger.balanceSheet()` returned; no second calculation. Added beside the old flat keys (`assets`, `liabilities`, `equity`, `total_assets_minor`, `total_liab_equity_minor`, `by_line`), which are unchanged. |
| `schedule_iii.equity_and_liabilities` / `.assets` | `{ heads: [{ line, label, total_minor, ledgers: [{ code, name, amount_minor }] }], total_minor }` | One side. `heads` follow the pack's Schedule III order. `total_minor` is the sum of that side's head totals. Amounts keep their sign. |
| `ledgers[].code` | string or null | null only for the year's profit line. |
| the profit line | `{ code: null, name: "Net profit" or "Net loss", amount_minor, role: "profit_to_date" }` | Sits in the `reserves_surplus` head (the owner's funds). Named "Net loss" when negative. |
| `schedule_iii.balanced` | boolean | `assets.total_minor === equity_and_liabilities.total_minor`. |
| `schedule_iii.difference_minor` | integer | `assets.total_minor - equity_and_liabilities.total_minor`. Never hidden; 0 when balanced. |
